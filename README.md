# 📘 Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning model for predicting loan approval decisions based on applicant financial and demographic information. By applying data preprocessing, feature engineering, and multiple classification algorithms, the project aims to identify key factors influencing approval outcomes and improve predictive accuracy.

The project objectives are:
- Build and evaluate models for loan approval classification.
- Compare linear and ensemble machine learning methods.
- Provide insights into the most influential features driving loan approvals.

# 🚀 Future Improvements

- Apply advanced ensemble methods (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) for higher accuracy.
- Use cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV).
- Handle class imbalance with SMOTE or other resampling methods.
- Incorporate explainable AI (XAI) tools such as SHAP or LIME to improve interpretability.
- Deploy the model as a web application to allow users to test loan approval predictions interactively.
